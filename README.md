Forms Based UI for MongoDB Atlas

# Docs

Docs are being written in google Docs for now

Getting Started: https://mdb.link/AtlasForms
Manual: https://mdb.link/AtlasFormsManual


## Introduction

Atlas forms is a Forms based, End user interface to allow users to Create, Find, Update, Delete and Link Records. It is similar to a Fourth Generation Language (4GL) in that it abstracts away all
database development where required and makes a Zero Coding solution to building an internal GUI
to interact with Data.

It differs from a 4GL in having no proprietery coding language - it si instead a skeleton application in modern Javascript running with serverless function on MongoDBs Atlas Developer Data PLatform. It is intended to be modified to fit rewuirements and has been designed to me modular and easily modified.

## Installation

Change llqdx to your own appid throught this repo and import.
If required edit data_sources/mongodb-atlas/config.json to point at your cluster

## Known BUGS to fix
- Needs a Delete Button
- Need to verify field contents in AF_Doctypes
- Offer sensible message if appid not set

## Improvements we could implement


- Error Handling review, Refactor, lint,tidy code

- All Strings in a consts class, inc errors and fieldnames
  

- Find a wat to Lint the JS for
  - use await not then
  - non ES6 style?
  - camel case
  - use of global vars
  - unchecked returns 
  - All Strings in a consts class, inc errors and fieldnames client and server.

- Hide buttons
  - If a user doesn't have the permissions to do something, hide the buttons related to that, eg. no write permissions should mean edit  and create are hidden

- Delete
 - Users with the correct permissions should have the ability to delete a document

- Mobile Layout CSS/swipes (Lots of this bootstrap gives us)

- Listview
  - Choose Columns from Cient

- FormView
    - Formview rememeber personal layout changes
    - Controls
      - boolean support (button/box)
      - Constraints & Validation 
        - On submit and on Change (Download JS to client??)
    - Date Only Chooser
    - 
- Printing (Stylesheet)
- Charts?
- Acessability
- Add Links (Does this need done)
